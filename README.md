## Sudoku Rules

The rules of sudoku are simple. You have a 9x9 grid, which is divided into 9 3x3 subgrids. The goal is to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, such that each row, column, and subgrid contains each number exactly once.

## Usage

The game is played by entering the row and column of the cell you want to fill, and the number you want to fill it with. For example, if you want to fill the cell in the first row and first column with the number 5, you would enter `1 1 5`.
